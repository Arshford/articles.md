# Articles
This repo contains a list of technical articles that need to be written down to better help clients.

It aims to resolve the problem of having to keep repeating tedius processes to resolve recurrent issues.

The articles will be published at truehost.com/support for access to our clients as well.

## How it Works
Each member of the suppor team will be added to this repo. As they work and find out issues that need documentation, they will open an issue here so that the articles can be scheduled and written.

Once written, the issue will be closed.
